  Needs doing:
==============================================================================

date nav:

* mechanism for filtering dates
* prev/next links
* custom range link

misc:

* change main pg to search by day (default, implied)
* nav fx: hfr


 * SEARCH NOW DOES AND ONLY: PROVIDE OR FUNCTIONALITY
 * Remove all {rewrite} links.
 * BUGFIX: cannot merge records
 * rewrite as a search-centric program, as header/search/facets/results/footer
 * quick-remove table item "hide"
 * reset cookie names
 * date range? remove? optional?
 * title: remove range from edit links (1970 bug)
 * Add option for NOT making something searchable
 * Cookie description textarea height
 * Watchlist titles for aspects (region/beat/etc...)
 * elasticsearch facets need to use a keyword tokenizer
 * London Bureau: Radio + Africa + Middle East + Europe query
